# Gemma Model Document Q&A

## Overview
The **Gemma Model Document Q&A** is a project designed to read and process documents, convert them into vectors, and perform question answering based on the document's content. This project leverages several key technologies such as **Langchain**, **FAISS**, **Streamlit**, and others to enable efficient vector search and natural language understanding.

## Features
- **Document Processing**: Reads documents and extracts their content for processing.
- **Vector Embedding**: Converts document text into vector representations using embedding models.
- **Question Answering**: Answers user queries by retrieving the most relevant parts of the document using vector-based search.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use web interface via **Streamlit**.

## Key Technologies
- **[Faiss CPU](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)**: An efficient vector search library for performing fast similarity search.
- **[Groq](https://groq.com/)**: High-performance hardware acceleration for AI workloads.
- **[Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)**: A framework for building language model applications.
- **[PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)**: A library for working with PDF files, used for document reading and text extraction.
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**: A Python-based framework for creating web applications, used to build the user interface for querying documents.
- **[Google GenAI](https://cloud.google.com/ai)**: Google’s Generative AI tool, integrated for enhanced language processing.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python packages:
- `faiss-cpu`: Efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- `groq`: For optimized AI performance on custom hardware.
- `langchain_groq`: Langchain integration with Groq hardware.
- `PyPDF2`: To extract text data from PDF documents.
- `langchain`: Framework for developing language models and chain-of-thought reasoning.
- `streamlit`: To create an interactive web interface.
- `langchain_community`: Community-based extensions for Langchain.
- `pypdf`: Alternative PDF processing library for handling different PDF types.
- `langchain_google_genai`: Integration with Google’s Generative AI models for enhanced question-answering capabilities.

## How It Works
1. **Document Input**: The user uploads a document (e.g., PDF), which is read and processed using **PyPDF2**.
2. **Vectorization**: The document is converted into vector embeddings using **Langchain** and **FAISS** for efficient searching.
3. **Question Answering**: The user inputs a query, which is processed by the system. Relevant document sections are retrieved based on vector similarity, and the answer is provided.
4. **Web Interface**: The **Streamlit** interface allows the user to interact with the system, upload documents, and ask questions.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu groq langchain_groq PyPDF2 langchain_google_genai langchain streamlit langchain_community pypdf
